HTML comments are used to add notes or annotations to HTML code. 
These comments are not displayed on the rendered webpage.
They are primarily intended for developers and designers to provide explanations, 
reminders, or instructions within the code. 

we use <!--content--> this symbol to give comments in HTML


Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Assignment-2</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is my first Webpage</h1> <!--Here h1 tag is used to give the font size little bigger as compare to other fonts that used inside the paragraph tags-->
  <!--Here p tag is used to form the content of paragraph inside the webpage-->
  <p>My name is Kiran Kumar Thapa. I am going through webDevelopment Course.<p>
  
  <!--'br' tag used to give space in between two lines of the paragraph-->
  <br>
</body>
</html>


In the above code example I have used the format of how we use comments in HTML.
